# rocBLAS/SOLVER option 1

In this option, the rocsolver project/repo is eliminated. Rocsolver code is added here as another directory. The project can build both libraries separately (librocblas.so and librocsolver.so), with its respective clients (rocblas-test/bench and rosolver-test/bench). When bulding both libraries, only one package containing both is generated... this way the rocsolver user always installs rocsolver with its companion compatible rocblas. Rocsolver can use all the rocblas common code that is needed. CI running in this repo will test both libraries to ensure that changes in rocblas don't break rocsolver, for example.

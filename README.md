# rocBLAS/SOLVER option 2

In this option, the rocsolver project/repo is eliminated. Rocsolver code is *inserted* as additional functionality. The project can build a library (librocblas.so for now, but we can change the name) with only BLAS functionality, or with both BLAS and LAPACK functionality. It also builds the clients (rocblas-test/bench) that could test rocblas functions or rocblas+rocsolver functions. This option proposes having a single more general library for numerical computations (like MAGMA). We could keep the name rocBLAS so that nothing changes for current rocblas users, or we can change for something more adequate like rocNLAL (Radeon Open Compute Numerical Linear Algebra Library), or something...
